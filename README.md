This is for CCBD internship

1) Internship question - Polygon Generator

Aim of this exercise is to generate random polygons having vertices from 10
upto 500, and save these shapes as WKT in a text file. Each WKT shape will be
delimited by a new line (\n) character. Plot the polygons using any
visualization software tool, onto a single canvas.

Bonus points:

1. Observe the file sizes and time taken to generate a large number of
polygons.

2. What kind of data distribution can be observed for objects like water
bodies, forests, constructed land/buildings, grassland, cultivated
land/agriculture. Can any of these variations be integrated into your
solution?
